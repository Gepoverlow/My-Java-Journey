# My Java Journey

## Chapter 1 - Java Fundamentals

Thanks to my experience with other programming languages, this chapter for me is just but an adaptation to the new syntax and terminologies to better build upon more complex subjects.

In this chapter we delve into the language fundamentals, including:

- Basic Syntax.
- Data Types, Variables.
- Conditionals.
- Functions.
- Loops.
- Exceptions / Exception Handling.
- Data Structures.
- OOP, Interfaces, Classes.
- Packages.
- Working with files and APIs.

## Chapter 2 - Getting Deeper

In this chapter we will have some more fun with more Java-specific topics!

Some of these include:

- Memory Management.
- Collection Framework.
- Serialization.
- Networking & Sockets.
- Generics.
- How JVM works?
- Garbage Collection.
- Basics of Threads.
- Streams.
